/game kit {kitname} (player) baconbrawl.cmd.admin.forcekit
/game join (gameName) (Player) baconbrawl.cmd.admin.forcejoin
/game leave (Player) baconbrawl.cmd.admin.forceleave

Working on spectate, shoud do start and stop

Essential:

Potential
-AutoRotate between maps
-non AutoRotate does not have PostGame
-Maybe Add DeathMode
-Econ?

Minor bugs:
-Durability still on, comes back when break block, and attack after

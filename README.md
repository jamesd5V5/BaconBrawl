Although quite simple, BaconBrawl was a treasured game my friends and I played on Mineplex. With their recent closing, I felt it would be fun to recreate for others to enjoy. Although other servers may be better, Mineplex will forever be in my friend's and my hearts.

*I*Bacon Brawl*I* takes the form of a free-for-all, where players have to fight to the death as different pigs. You spawn as a pig (or a sheep, depending on your kit) on a map either floating above a void or surrounded by lava or water. You have to knock your opponents off the edge to kill them; simply hitting them will not work, as their health (and yours) constantly regenerates.

This is a simple full in-game setup tutorial to make a game.

**1.** `/game new BaconBrawl <AnyMapName>`
   - Now a menu should have popped up. If not, type "/game tools"
   - Click all the tools, which should put them into your inventory

**2.** Now it's time to set the game's locations
   - *The First thing you MUST do* is to set the game's region using the Region tool. As of most locations must be within the set game's region. Use the Region tool given. If you ever used WorldEdit, this should be easy. LeftClick to set the lower left corner of the map, and RightClick to set the upper right corner of the map.
   - *DeathSpawn Tool:* Sets the location to where people spawn when killed. [Must be within the Region set]
   - *Lobby Tool:* Sets the location to where people teleport to when selecting kits and waiting for players [Must be within the Region set]
   - *PlayerSpawnPoint Tool:* Set the player spawnpoints. [Must be within the Region set]
   - *PostGame Location Tool:* Set the location to where players are teleported to see the results of the game [Must be within the Region set]
   - *ReturnBack Location:* Set the location to where the players are teleported when they leave the mini-game.

**3.** `/game edit <MapName>` (All players leave edit mode)
   - If you ever want to edit the game, just type /game edit <MapName> again.
